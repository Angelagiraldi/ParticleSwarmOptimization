# Temporary set of notes:
#
# * Before executing the command below:
#   - PSO_input must be a symbolic-link pointing to the target input directory
#   - the input directory must contain a sub-directory called 2017/,
#   - which in turn must contain two files called background.root and signal.root
#
./runPSO_exe.sh [path to output dir] [space-separated list of config files]
