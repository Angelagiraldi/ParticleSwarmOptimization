# Notes (temporary):

 * Example:
```
./runPSO_exe.sh test_output_dir config/fullRun2_preUL_v02/2017/v02/BDT_step7_cate*.txt
```
 * Before executing the command below:
   - PSO_input must be a symbolic-link pointing to the target input directory;
   - the input directory must contain a sub-directory called 2017/,
     which in turn must contain two files called background.root and signal.root.
